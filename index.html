🧠 Scientific Approach

Our research focuses on integrating vision, language, and action (VLA) models into real-world robot systems.
We explore topics such as:

Vision-Language Grounding for Object Manipulation

Operational Space Control for Manipulator Robots

Real-to-Sim Transfer and Reinforcement Learning

Robust Multi-Modal Perception in Dynamic Environments

Our approach is grounded in scientific reproducibility and open-source collaboration.

📜 Research Statement:

“We believe that robust human-robot collaboration emerges from integrating high-level reasoning (language) with low-level control (physics). Our systems aim to demonstrate interpretable autonomy through modular, data-driven architectures.”
